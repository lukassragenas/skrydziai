# Skrydziai
Reference sheet for the project. To be edited when more relevant info needs to be displayed in a convenient location.

## Installation

Since github doesn't track all of the files that are needed for the application to fucntion, there is some setup work that needs to be 
done. 
This guide is relevant for windows users, using [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to host the website locally.

### Prerequisite software

[Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for hosting the website. Apache, MySql and PHP are included in the instalation and don't
have to be installed separately.

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for managing dependencies. I recommend to download the installer and not bother with the 
command line installation method.

**Handy, but not necessarily needed:** <br/>
[Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - a conveniant tool for collaboration with git. Provides a graphical user interface for 
git, so work can be done without using the git bash.

### Cloning the repository

Now when xampp is installed, you need to clone the reposiroty into the Xampp/htdocs folder. Instructions on how to clone a repository can 
be found [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/clone-repository-github-desktop). Just don't forget to set the local path to a subfolder of Xampp/htdocs (**example path:** C:\Users\Ikiwi\Desktop\XAMPP\htdocs\skrydziai).

### Downloading required libraries

Since we're using Laravel framework our code is dependent on external libraries. To download those libraries follow these steps: <br/>

1. Run windows command prompt as an aministrator.
2. Navigate to /skrydziai directory (with cmd).
3. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    composer install
    ```
All of the required libs should be installed now without the need to do anything else.

### Setting application encryption key

Laravel framework requires an encryption key and an .env file. This file should be located in \skrydziai folder along with .env.example. 
If it's not there (which it will likely be, if you cloned the repo), you need to create it and copy .env.example file content into it.
This can be easily done by simply running this command in cmd (make sure you are in \skrydziai directory).
```shell
copy .env.example .env
```
Add stripe api key and secret to .env file:
```
STRIPE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET=
```

After the .env file is there and filled with .env.example content, run:
```shell
php artisan key:generate
```

### Creating storage folders

Navigate to \skrydziai directory and run the following commands into cmd:
```shell
php artisan storage:link
```

### Database setup

First you need to create the database itself and setup a user account for that database using phpmyadmin. Instructions on how to to that
can be found [Here](http://webvaultwiki.com.au/Create-Mysql-Database-User-Phpmyadmin.ashx). Don't create any tables yet, that will
be done through migrations. <br/>

Once that is done, open up the .env file (located in \skrydziai) and change DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD to match the values that you chose during database creation process. </br>

Once the database is connected, navigate to \skrydziai folder with cmd and run the following command:
```shell
php artisan migrate
```
All the required tables will be created using the migration files located [here](https://github.com/nikamodis/skrydziai/tree/master/database/migrations)

After that, run the following command, to create admin user:
```shell
php artisan db:seed
```

Admin user logins:
```shell
admin@gmail.com
Admin123.
```
Stripe test credentials:

```
Name on card: Test
Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
CSV: 123
Expiration Month: 12
Expiration Year: 2024
```
